# PbSnalloys

Here, we present all the converged structures related to the CsPb<sub>1-x</sub>Sn<sub>x</sub>I<sub>3</sub>. The folders are named in accordance with the Glazer's notation which identifies the polymorph, i.e. a-a+a-, a+a-a+, a0a0a0, a0b-b+, a0b+b+.

Within the folders, the converged structures are identified as **POSCAR_nSn_occupancy_deg-gj**, where:

- POSCAR: standard name used in VASP code;
- nSn: number of Sn atoms in the configuration;
- occupancy: site occupancy, in order 12345678, with A = Pb and B = Sn;
- gj: the class degeneracy number, calculated according to the symmetry operations related to the crystal's spacegroup.
