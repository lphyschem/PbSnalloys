# PbSnalloys

Here, we present all the converged structures related to the CsPb<sub>1-x</sub>Sn<sub>x</sub>I<sub>3</sub>. The folders are named in accordance with the Glazer's notation which identifies the polymorph. Within the folders, the sturectures are identified as POSCAR_nSn_occupancy_deg-gj, where:

POSCAR: standard name used in VASP code
nSn: number of Sn atoms in the configuration
occupancy: site occupancy, in order 12345678, with A = Pb and B = Sn
gj: degeneracy number of class, calculated according to the symmetry operations within the crystal's spacegroup.
